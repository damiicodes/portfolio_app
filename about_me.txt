Hello there! My name is Dami Fajinmi, and I'm a Junior Data Engineer.
I completed a coding bootcamp called 'Sky Get into Tech' and then taught myself
Python and SQL to become a Data Engineer. Prior to this, I was working as a Data Analyst.
As a self-taught developer, I have a passion for learning new programming skills
and exploring different technologies.

Fun fact: I share my workspace with two adorable dogs who are always eager to lend a paw.
They're my faithful companions and never fail to make me smile,
even during the most complex coding challenges.
When I'm not busy building data pipelines,
I enjoy taking my dogs on outdoor adventures and exploring new trails. Or you can find me curled up
reading a novel, or catching up on the latest movies.

Thank you for visiting my programming portfolio, and feel free to reach out
if you have any questions or just want to chat about dogs (or programming!).
